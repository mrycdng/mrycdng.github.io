                a philosophical and introspective lyric essay of suffering and the limitations of vision and love 
                told through the lens of the colour <span class="bluetag">blue</span>.</div>

                <p>6. The half-circle of blinding <span class="bluetag">turquoise</span> ocean is this love’s primal
                    scene. That this <span class="bluetag">blue</span>
                    exists makes my life a remarkable one, just to have seen it. To have seen such beautiful
                    things. To find oneself placed in their midst. Choiceless. I returned there yesterday and
                    stood again upon the mountain.</p>
                <p>7. But what kind of love is it, really? Don’t fool yourself and call it sublimity. Admit
                    that you have stood in front of a little pile of powdered <span class="bluetag">ultramarine</span>
                    pigment in a glass
                    cup at a museum and felt a stinging desire. But to do what? Liberate it? Purchase it?
                    Ingest it? There is so little <span class="bluetag">blue</span> food in nature—in fact <span
                        class="bluetag">blue</span> in the wild tends to mark
                    food to avoid (mold, poisonous berries)—that culinary advisers generally recommend
                    against <span class="bluetag">blue</span> light, <span class="bluetag">blue</span> paint, and <span
                        class="bluetag">blue</span> plates when and where serving food. But while
                    the color may sap appetite in the most literal sense, it feeds it in others. You might want
                    to reach out and disturb the pile of pigment, for example, first staining your fingers with
                    it, then staining the world. You might want to dilute it and swim in it, you might want to
                    rouge your nipples with it, you might want to paint a virgin’s robe with it. But still you
                    wouldn’t be accessing the <span class="bluetag">blue</span> of it. Not exactly.</p>

                <p>91. <span class="bluetag">Blue</span>-eye, archaic: “a <span class="bluetag">blue</span>ness or dark
                    circle around the eye, from weeping or other cause.</p>

                <p>134. It calms me to think of <span class="bluetag">blue</span> as the color of death. I have long
                    imagined death’s
                    approach as the swell of a wave—a towering wall of <span class="bluetag">blue</span>. You will
                    drown, the world
                    tells me, has always told me. You will descend into a <span class="bluetag">blue</span> underworld,
                    <span class="bluetag">blue</span> with
                    hungry ghosts, <span class="bluetag">Krishna blue</span>, the <span class="bluetag">blue</span>
                    faces of the ones you loved. They all drowned,
                    too. To take a breath of water: does the thought panic or excite you? If you are in love
                    with red then you slit or shoot. If you are in love with <span class="bluetag">blue</span> you fill
                    your pouch with
                    stones good for sucking and head down to the river. Any river will do.</p>
                <p>135. Of course one can have “the blues” and stay alive, at least for a time.
                    “Productive,” even (the perennial consolation!). See, for example, “Lady Sings the
                    Blues”: “She’s got them bad / She feels so sad / Wants the world to know / Just what her
                    blues is all about.” Nonetheless, as Billie Holiday knew, it remains the case that to see
                    <span class="bluetag">blue</span> in deeper and deeper saturation is eventually to move toward darkness.</p>
