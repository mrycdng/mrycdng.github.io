            Given such a huge misconception, there is scarcely any wonder that your randomly chosen persons are unlikely
            to realize that research in mathematics is a thriving, worldwide activity, or to accept a suggestion that
            mathematics permeates, often to a considerable extent, most walks of present-day life and society.

            Up to 500 B.C. or thereabouts, mathematics was indeed the study of numbers. This was the period of Egyptian
            and Babylonian mathematics. In those civilizations, mathematics consisted almost solely of arithmetic. It
            was largely utilitarian, and very much of a 'cookbook' nature

            The period from around 500 B.C. to A.D. 300 was the era of Greek mathematics. The mathematicians of ancient
            Greece were primarily concerned with geometry. Indeed, they regarded numbers in a geometric fashion, as
            measurements of length, and when they discovered that there were lengths to which their numbers did not
            correspond (irrational lengths), their study of number largely came to a halt. For the Greeks, with their
            emphasis on geometry, mathematics was the study of number and shape.

        <p class="normal_body">
            In fact, it was only with the Greeks that mathematics came into being as an area of study, and ceased being
            a collection of techniques for measuring, counting, and accounting. The Greeks' interest in mathematics was
            not just utilitarian; they regarded mathematics as an intellectual pursuit having both aesthetic and
            religious elements. Thales introduced the idea that the precisely stated assertions of mathematics could be
            logically proved by a formal argument. This innovation marked the birth of the theorem, now the bedrock of
            mathematics. For the Greeks, this approach culminated in the publication of Euclid's Elements, reputedly the
            most widely circulated book of all time after the Bible.

            There were no major changes in the overall nature of mathematics, and hardly any significant advances within
            the subject, until the middle of the seventeenth century, when Newton (in England) and Leibniz (in Germany)
            independently invented the calculus. In essence, the calculus is the study of motion and change. Previous
            mathematics had been largely restricted to the static issues of counting, measuring, and describing shape.
            With the introduction of techniques to handle motion and change, mathematicians were able to study the
            motion of the planets and of falling bodies on earth, the workings of machinery, the flow of liquids, the
            expansion of gases, physical forces such as magnetism and electricity, flight, the growth of plants and
            animals, the spread of epidemics, the fluctuation of profits, and so on. After Newton and Leibniz,
            mathematics became the study of number, shape, motion, change, and space.

            Most of the initial work involving the calculus was directed toward the study of physics; indeed, many of
            the great mathematicians of the period are also regarded as physicists. But from about the middle of the
            eighteenth century there was an increasing interest in the mathematics itself, not just its applications, as
            mathematicians sought to understand what lay behind the enormous power that the calculus gave to humankind.
            Here the old Greek tradition of formal proof came back into ascendancy, as a large part of present-day pure
            mathematics was developed. By the end of the nineteenth century, mathematics had become the study of number,
            shape, motion, change, and space,

            The explosion of mathematical activity that took place in the twentieth century was dramatic. In the year
            1900, all the world's mathematical knowledge would have fitted into about eighty books. Today it would take
            maybe a hundred thousand volumes to contain all known mathematics. This extraordinary growth has not only
            been a furtherance of previous mathematics; many quite new branches of mathematics have sprung up. In 1900,
            mathematics could reasonably be regarded as consisting of about twelve distinct subjects: arithmetic,
            geometry, calculus, and so on. Today, between sixty and seventy distinct categories would be a reasonable
            figure. Some subjects, such as algebra and topology, have split into various subfields; others, such as
            complexity theory or dynamical systems theory, are completely new areas of study.

            The Science of Patterns

        <p class="normal_body">
            Given this tremendous growth in mathematical activity, for a while it seemed as though the only simple
            answer to the question "What is mathematics?" was to say, somewhat fatuously, "It is what mathematicians do
            for a living." A particular study was classified as mathematics not so much because of what was studied but
            because of how it was studied—that is, the methodology used. It was only within the last thirty years or so
            that a definition of mathematics emerged on which most mathematicians now agree:
        </p>
        <p class="z_body" id="z11">

        <p class="huge_body">
            mathematics is the science of patterns.
        </p>
        <p class="normal_body">
            What the mathematician does is examine abstract 'patterns'—numerical patterns, patterns of shape, patterns
            of motion, patterns of behavior, voting patterns in a population, patterns of repeating chance events, and
            so on. Those patterns can be either real or imagined, visual or mental, static or dynamic, qualitative or
            quantitative, purely utilitarian or of little more than recreational interest. They can arise from the world
            around us, from the depths of space and time, or from the inner workings of the human mind. Different kinds
            of patterns give rise to different branches of mathematics. For example:

            To convey something of this modern conception of mathematics, this book takes eight general themes, covering
            patterns of counting, patterns of reasoning and communicating, patterns of motion and change, patterns of
            shape, patterns of symmetry and regularity, patterns of position, patterns of chance, and the fundamental
            patterns of the universe. Though this selection leaves out a number of major areas of mathematics, it should
            provide a good overall sense of what contemporary mathematics is about. The treatment of each theme, while
            at a purely descriptive level, is not superficial.

            One aspect of modern mathematics that is obvious to even the casual observer is the use of abstract
            notation: algebraic expressions, complicated-looking formulas, and geometric diagrams. The mathematician's
            reliance on abstract notation is a reflection of the abstract nature of the patterns he studies.

        <p class="normal_body">
            Different aspects of reality require different forms of description. For example, the most appropriate way
            to study the lay of the land or to describe to someone how to find their way around a strange town is to
            draw a map. Text is far less appropriate. Analogously, line drawings in the form of blueprints are the most
            appropriate way to specify the construction of a building. And musical notation is the most appropriate way
            to convey music, apart from, perhaps, actually playing the piece.

        </p>
        <p class="normal_body">
            In the case of various kinds of abstract, 'formal' patterns and abstract structures, the most appropriate
            means of description and analysis is mathematics, using mathematical notation, concepts, and procedures. For
            instance, the symbolic notation of algebra is the most appropriate means of describing and analyzing the
            general behavioral properties of addition and multiplication. The commutative law for addition, for example,
            could be written in English as
        </p>
        <p class="z_body" id="z17">
            zzz____z_z_zzz_____zz_zzz__zz_zz_z_zzz____zz_z____zz__z_z__zzz_z_zz__zz_z__z_zz___z_z
        </p>
        <p class="huge_body">
            When two numbers are added, their order is not important.
        </p>
        <p class="z_body" id="z18">
            _zzz___z___zz__z_z_zz_zzz__zz_z___z_zz___zzzz_zz__z_z__z_zzz_zz__zzz__zzzz_z_zz__z_zz_
        </p>
        <p class="normal_body">However, it is usually written in the symbolic form
        </p>
        <p class="huge_body">
            m + n = n + m.
        </p>
        <p class="z_body" id="z19">

        </p>
        <p class="normal_body">
            Such is the complexity and the degree of abstraction of the majority of mathematical patterns that to use
            anything other than symbolic notation would be prohibitively cumbersome. And so the development of
            mathematics has involved a steady increase in the use of abstract notation.
