            With a bit of prodding as to what kind of study they mean,
            you may be able to induce them to come up with the description

            “the science of numbers.”
        </p>

            But that is about as far as you will get. And with that, you will have obtained a description of mathematics
            that ceased to be accurate some two and a half thousand years ago!

            Given such a huge misconception, there is scarcely any wonder that your randomly chosen persons are unlikely
            to realize that research in mathematics is a thriving, worldwide activity, or to accept a suggestion that
            mathematics permeates, often to a considerable extent, most walks of present-day life and society.

            Up to 500 B.C. or thereabouts, mathematics was indeed the study of numbers. This was the period of Egyptian
            and Babylonian mathematics. In those civilizations, mathematics consisted almost solely of arithmetic. It
            was largely utilitarian, and very much of a “cookbook” nature

            The period from around 500 B.C. to A.D. 300 was the era of Greek mathematics. The mathematicians of ancient
            Greece were primarily concerned with geometry. Indeed, they regarded numbers in a geometric fashion, as
            measurements of length, and when they discovered that there were lengths to which their numbers did not
            correspond (irrational lengths), their study of number largely came to a halt. For the Greeks, with their
            emphasis on geometry, mathematics was the study of number and shape.

            In fact, it was only with the Greeks that mathematics came into being as an area of study, and ceased being
            a collection of techniques for measuring, counting, and accounting. The Greeks’ interest in mathematics was
            not just utilitarian; they regarded mathematics as an intellectual pursuit having both aesthetic and
            religious elements. Thales introduced the idea that the precisely stated assertions of mathematics could be
            logically proved by a formal argument. This innovation marked the birth of the theorem, now the bedrock of
            mathematics. For the Greeks, this approach culminated in the publication of Euclid’s Elements, reputedly the
            most widely circulated book of all time after the Bible.

            There were no major changes in the overall nature of mathematics, and hardly any significant advances within
            the subject, until the middle of the seventeenth century, when Newton (in England) and Leibniz (in Germany)
            independently invented the calculus. In essence, the calculus is the study of motion and change. Previous
            mathematics had been largely restricted to the static issues of counting, measuring, and describing shape.
            With the introduction of techniques to handle motion and change, mathematicians were able to study the
            motion of the planets and of falling bodies on earth, the workings of machinery, the flow of liquids, the
            expansion of gases, physical forces such as magnetism and electricity, flight, the growth of plants and
            animals, the spread of epidemics, the fluctuation of profits, and so on. After Newton and Leibniz,
            mathematics became the study of number, shape, motion, change, and space.

            Most of the initial work involving the calculus was directed toward the study of physics; indeed, many of
            the great mathematicians of the period are also regarded as physicists. But from about the middle of the
            eighteenth century there was an increasing interest in the mathematics itself, not just its applications, as
            mathematicians sought to understand what lay behind the enormous power that the calculus gave to humankind.
            Here the old Greek tradition of formal proof came back into ascendancy, as a large part of present-day pure
            mathematics was developed. By the end of the nineteenth century, mathematics had become the study of number,
            shape, motion, change, and space,
        </p>
        <p class="huge_body">
            and of the mathematical tools that are used in this study.

            The explosion of mathematical activity that took place in the twentieth century was dramatic. In the year
            1900, all the world’s mathematical knowledge would have fitted into about eighty books. Today it would take
            maybe a hundred thousand volumes to contain all known mathematics. This extraordinary growth has not only
            been a furtherance of previous mathematics; many quite new branches of mathematics have sprung up. In 1900,
            mathematics could reasonably be regarded as consisting of about twelve distinct subjects: arithmetic,
            geometry, calculus, and so on. Today, between sixty and seventy distinct categories would be a reasonable
            figure. Some subjects, such as algebra and topology, have split into various subfields; others, such as
            complexity theory or dynamical systems theory, are completely new areas of study.
