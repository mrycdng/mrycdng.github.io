            What is mathematics? Ask this question of persons chosen at random, and you are likely to receive the answer

            “Mathematics is the study of numbers”

            With a bit of prodding as to what kind of study they mean,
            you may be able to induce them to come up with the description

        <p class="big_body">
            “the science of numbers.”
        </p>
        <p class="normal_body">
            But that is about as far as you will get. And with that, you will have obtained a description of mathematics
            that ceased to be accurate some two and a half thousand years ago!

            Given such a huge misconception, there is scarcely any wonder that your randomly chosen persons are unlikely
            to realize that research in mathematics is a thriving, worldwide activity, or to accept a suggestion that
            mathematics permeates, often to a considerable extent, most walks of present-day life and society.

            Up to 500 B.C. or thereabouts, mathematics was indeed the study of numbers. This was the period of Egyptian
            and Babylonian mathematics. In those civilizations, mathematics consisted almost solely of arithmetic. It
            was largely utilitarian, and very much of a “cookbook” nature

            The period from around 500 B.C. to A.D. 300 was the era of Greek mathematics. The mathematicians of ancient
            Greece were primarily concerned with geometry. Indeed, they regarded numbers in a geometric fashion, as
            measurements of length, and when they discovered that there were lengths to which their numbers did not
            correspond (irrational lengths), their study of number largely came to a halt. For the Greeks, with their
            emphasis on geometry, mathematics was the study of number and shape.

            In fact, it was only with the Greeks that mathematics came into being as an area of study, and ceased being
            a collection of techniques for measuring, counting, and accounting. The Greeks’ interest in mathematics was
            not just utilitarian; they regarded mathematics as an intellectual pursuit having both aesthetic and
            religious elements. Thales introduced the idea that the precisely stated assertions of mathematics could be
            logically proved by a formal argument. This innovation marked the birth of the theorem, now the bedrock of
            mathematics. For the Greeks, this approach culminated in the publication of Euclid’s Elements, reputedly the
            most widely circulated book of all time after the Bible.
