                ‚ÄúThe Big Apple‚Äù is a nickname for New York City. It was first popularized in the 1920s by John J. Fitz Gerald, a sportswriter for the <i>New York Morning Telegraph</i>. Its popularity since the 1970s is due in part to a promotional campaign by the New York tourist authorities.

                The earliest known usage of "big apple" appears in the book <i>The Wayfarer in New York</i> (1909), in which Edward Sandford Martin writes: ‚ÄúKansas is apt to see in New York a greedy city ... It inclines to think that the big apple gets a disproportionate share of the national sap.‚Äù
